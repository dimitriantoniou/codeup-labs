<h2>Building custom software is hard - we make it easy</h2>
<h3>Your problem:</h3>
<p>Whether you're an established company looking to increase efficiency through automation or a startup launching an app,
    custom software can save you time and money. But getting custom software built is hard: which devs should you trust?
    What technologies should you use? How can you make sure your product will launch on time?</p>
<h3>Our solution: Codeup Labs X Turner Logic</h3>
    <p>With 6 years of training software developers at Codeup and 7 years of building software at Turner Logic, our partnership
        leverages expertise from all angles. Not only do we train and place developers, but now we develop software too.
        With co-founder of Codeup, founder of Turner Logic, and former Senior Software Developer at Lockheed Martin/CEO Chris Turner
        as your guide, we'll lead you from design through deployment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design - You know your idea, we know software. Together we can scope, design, and plan a new app.</li>
            <li>Develop - Our customer-focused approach makes sure you have insight into the development process and that our product meets your needs.</li>
            <li>Deploy - Don't let your shiny new software sit on the shelf. We'll help you deploy and implement your application so you can show it off to the world AND start earning back your investment.</li>
        </ul>
